### Why?
Okay, let's start with why. Mostly because I'm very bored. I'm *apparently* a lot better then the most people in my class. (Probably mainly because I have been coding since my 12th.) But I also wanted to bring something to the community, the community I have been a part of for a long long time!

### What does it do?
It saves basically saves all the information the user gives. And uses it later when a different user tries to access the post. The program then bypasses Cloudflare, logges into an account and views the profile to see if the verification string is in there.

### I dont should have all the credits
Look at cloudscraper https://pypi.org/project/cloudscraper/, and awesome cloudflare bypassing module which basically did 80% of the work! :D

### Why json?
Well, I didnt feel like putting more work into this because its basically a free service.


(This project wasnt mainly made for the "Coding Section Competition" on V3rmillion)
Please, V3rmillion staff, if you need any help with the development map, I really want to help, I'm bored :(
